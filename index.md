In each exercise, you need to calculate the answers x, y, Z of the three equations respectively, and make the answers meet the following equation: (x + y)% 5 = = (x + Z)% 5. Before that, you need to challenge the number of each space and fill in the correct number. It's an interesting and meaningful thinking process to help you practice the ability of arithmetic equations.
